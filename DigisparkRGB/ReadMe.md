# Digispark RGB

## How to install:
In this repository everything is already done for you!

There is nothing you have to do other than downloading the corresponding ZIP File.

1. Create a new Sketch (or use an existing one), you want the library to be included
2. Press in the navigation Menu on "Sketch > Include Library > Include .zip Library" *(if using ArduinoIDE)*
3. Select the ZIP File you just downloaded from this directory.
4. The library should have installed correctly. You can see if it has or hasnt installed properly in the "Output" Console.
5. With the installed library you now only have to include ` #include <DigisparkRGB.h> ` in the top lines (before your other code)


Properly following this steps will allow you to implement the DigisparkRGB library directly into your IDE
without having any issues!
